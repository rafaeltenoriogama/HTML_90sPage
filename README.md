## Welcome to My 90s Style HTML Page

### Description

This project is a from the course HTML make it on **DIO Innovation One** and I call it a 1990s aesthetic because the goal of this project is not using or using the minimal CSS to recreate a look from that area, since we are learning HTML not focus on extra stylesheets.

By doing so, the project is a nostalgic throwback to the web design aesthetic of the 1990s.
